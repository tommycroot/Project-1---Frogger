# Project-1---Frogger

The brief was that we had 1 week to make a playable game.
I decided to create Frogger, having fond memories of it as a child.

The idea of Frogger is to guide a frog across a grid and to the top of the screen. The game is made 
challenging due to moving obstacles across the grid that the frog must avoid to reach its destination.

The game is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Planning:

Wireframe:

The wireframe was created using Exalidraw:

I created the plan this way so I could visualise how the game was going to be structured, what features to
include and what sort of functionality would need to be included.

The Grid:


Firstly, I had to create a grid for Frogger to move around in and for obstacles to move across.
By using DOM manipulation on an empty div, I was able to push cells into it to create my grid.
I used a for loop to create the grid.
